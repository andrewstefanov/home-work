<h1>CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)
CCENT (Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician) Boot Camp</h1>
<h2>New York City or Washington, DC</h2>
<h2>The CCNA Router and Switching certification is one of the most popular certification in the networking industry. The Cisco CCNA Router and Switching certification validates the ability to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot medium-size routed and switched networks, including implementation and verification of connections to remote sites in a WAN.</h2>
 

<p>This course covers both Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices(ICND) 1 and Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices(ICND) 2. Using a combination of labs and lectures we are able to cover the exam topics thoroughly. The course covers the 200-120 CCNA Router and Switching exam or the 100-101, 100-102 ICND's exam. Students would need to pass either the single 200-120 or both ICND exams to be CCNA certified. Students can also take just 100-102 to become CCENT certified.</p>
 
<p align=center>We offer the best hands on approach to CCNA/CCENT training. By utilizing a combination of over 25 different labs and working with the actual routers and switches students are able to easily understand the concepts and theory.</p>
